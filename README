=== SETUP

1) Make sure that Matlab, GCC (or compiler of choice), and NVCC are available. Test that
	* which matlab gcc nvcc
	all indicate an executable and not 'no file ... in path'
2) Copy Make.config.default to Make.config so you can edit it without git being git
3) Edit Make.config with paths to the required libraries
	a. If you are using the Modules system:
		* load up matlab, mpi, cuda
		* matlab r2011b, mpi-1.5.4, cuda-4.2 and gcc-4.5 are a known-working combo
	b. Check $PATH and use the paths to mpi, cuda & matlab to edit Make.config
	c. If using modules, make sure that the run/imogen invocation script loads
		the same modules as used to compile
3) Compile the MPI bindings and CUDA kernels:
	* from the imogen root: cd mpi; make; cd ../gpuclass; make
	* These are both shitty about -j but there isn't much to build
	* Poke one of the mexa64 files in both /mpi and /gpuclass with ldd and see that
		it can see all the required .so files, in particular libmpi_f90. If not then
		something is probably unhappy with versioning; make sure the libs you reference
		in Make.config, run/imogen and have loaded are the same.
	* ldd won't see the Matlab mex .so's; Matlab modifies your environment to provide them


=== USE

The Imogen Magnetohydrodynamics Code is an advanced astrophysical simulation tool. It solves the
equations of compressible ideal MHD using a TVD method that is second order in space and time.

Simulations are started from the run/ directory using the 'imogen' command residing there. Run
	./imogen help
to get information on how to invoke Imogen. Currently cluster invocation assumes the use if qsub
and a Torque that feeds mpi the list of nodes to be used; Otherwise modification will be required -
please email changes for this to [ekeever1@uoregon.edu]

Imogen runs in parallel on both the GPU and on multiple computers with GPUs via MPI.
