The Imogen Magnetohydrodynamics Code is an advanced astrophysical simulation tool. It solves the
equations of compressible ideal MHD using a TVD method that is second order in space and time.

Simulations are started from the run/ directory, normally in the form
  ./imogen runfile_Name.m number &
where 'number' causes output to be directed to ~/Results/logfile_number.out and the & detaches the
simulation from the console. Output will be stored in ~/Results/MONTH_YY in a simulation-dependent
directory.

=== GPU support

Imogen supports operations both on the CPU of any computer that can run Matlab, and on the GPU of
any such computer with a supported nVidia GPU (compute capability >= 1.3) through GPUmat.

In order to use the GPU features, one must have GPUmat installed and working and also use the
nVidia CUDA toolkit to compile the kernels in gravity/utils [where they sit for historical reasons].
