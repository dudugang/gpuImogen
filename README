The Imogen Magnetohydrodynamics Code is an advanced astrophysical simulation tool. It solves the
equations of compressible ideal MHD using a TVD method that is second order in space and time.

Simulations are started from the run/ directory using the 'imogen' command residing there. Run
  ./imogen help
to get information on the ways of running Imogen.

Imogen runs in parallel on both the GPU and on multiple computers via MPI.

You must edit Make.config appropriately, then run 'make' in both the mpi and gpuclass directories
to build the compiled components.
