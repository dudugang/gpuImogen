function result = indexSet(dims, xset, yset, zset)
% Given the dimensions in dims and sets of x, y and z coordinates,
% This function takes the volume spanned by the cartesian of xset x yset x zset
% and returns [linear x y z] Nx4 matrix corresponding to the linear and x y z
% indicies corresponding to the selected points

% FIXME: This is now done by StaticsInitializer.indexSetForVolume
