\subsection{Richtmyer-Meshkov Instability Test}

RMI occurs whenever a plane shockwave becomes incident upon a non-uniform density interface. 
The plane shock refracts through the interface, imparting differential vorticity that drives
a jet from the denser fluid into the lighter fluid.

\subsubsection{Analysis}

\subsubsection{Initial Conditions}


The physical input parameters to the Richtmyer-Meshkov Instability test are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \tt{mach} - Defines the mach speed of the incoming shock wave
\item \tt{rhotop} - Defines the density of the lighter fluid 
\item \tt{rhobottom} - Defines the density of the heavier fluid
\end{itemize}
