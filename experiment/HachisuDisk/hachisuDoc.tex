\subsection{Hachisu (HSCF) Disk Simulation}

The Hachisu disk simulation generates a self-gravitating thick torus using the
method of Hachisu (1982) of solving the Poisson gravity equation simultaneously
with the q-parameterized rotation on cylinders model of a cylindrically symmetric gas disk.

This simulation is... not happy.
