\subsection{Sod Tube Test}

This test was used by Gary Sod in his 1976 paper that compared numerous then-in-use schemes
for 1D simulation of compressible supersonic dynamics.

While the original test parameters are no longer particularly challenging for any modern 
shock-capturing code, the Sod test is an enduring part of any test suite.

\subsubsection{Initial Conditions}

The Sod test refers to the solution of a particular Riemann problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\rho(x) = \{ 1, x < 0; .125, x \ge 0 \}$
\item $P(x) = \{ 1, x < 0; .1, x \ge 0 \} $
\item $\vec{v} = \vec{0}$
\end{itemize}
in an ideal gas with $\gamma = 7/5$.

Imogen uses a box of length 1, constant BCs, and runs to a time of 0.25.
