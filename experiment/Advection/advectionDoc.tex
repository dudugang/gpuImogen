\subsection{Advection Test}

The advection test places a single characteristic wave (sonic or entropic) onto a grid.

The fluid is time-evolved, and for saved data for which the critical time $t_*$ has not 
been exceeded the solution is compared with an analytic solution from a characteristic
analysis.
