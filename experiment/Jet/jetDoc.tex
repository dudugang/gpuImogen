\subsection{Jet Test}

The jet test simulation initializes a uniform background, then sets up a fixed `injector' box
which fires fast-moving fluid into this background.

\subsubsection{Analysis}

Depending on the mach and the density of the injector fluid, several interesting behaviors are observable:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mach diamonds
\item KH instability: The jet always creates intense shearing motion, which results in KH turbulence at the jet/background boundary
\item RT instability: If the injector fluid is of low density, light fluid is accelerated into dense fluid and the ``bubble'' it blows out quickly deforms
\item Sound generation: A large simulation with long runtimes will be seen emitting sound waves into the far-field, away from the actual jet action
\end{itemize}
