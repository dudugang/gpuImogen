\subsection{Kelvin-Helmholtz Shearing Box Test}

The Kelvin-Helmholtz effect refers to the instability of a shearing surface to transverse structure formation.
It was first analyzed by Lord Kelvin (1871) and Hermann von Helmholtz (1868).

\subsubsection{Initial Conditions}

Imogen sets up the shearing motion in the X direction.

The initial conditions describe two regions of fluid at equal pressures, with opposite momenta
(such that the resulting structure is 'nominally stationary').
