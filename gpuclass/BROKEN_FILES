Statuses:
OBSOLETE:   Not needed by new toolkit
dead:       No porting work done
builds:     A shim is theoretically present but it only builds, isn't tested
shim:       New toolkit has been slipped in but assumes single-device and MD will spectacularly fail
WORKSFORME: Looks like it works but not verified or such
VERIFIED:   Systematically tested and fuzzed

Need codes:
E = essential
M = magnetic flow
P = parallel operation
S = source terms

These I think are never used so they're dead last priority:
cudaMagNew.cu			| dead (MHD-ONLY)		| M
cudaPointPotentials.cu		| dead (compact objects only)
freezeAndPtot_new.cu		| dead
