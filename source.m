function source(run, mass, mom, ener, mag, grav)
% This function sources the non-conservative terms in the MHD equations like gravitational potential
% and radiation terms. Effectively it provides the means to add terms that cannot be brought within 
% the del operator, which is the foundation of the spatial fluxing routines.

    %--- Gravitational Potential Sourcing ---%

    %       in both the momentum and energy equations must be appended as source terms.
